  content: `Every compliance platform in the market was built the same way: manual workflows with AI bolted on later. [Delve](/company/delve) flipped the script. Built AI-first by two MIT dropouts who were 21 at the time, the platform uses autonomous agents to get startups SOC 2 compliant in days, not months.

The result: $300M valuation at Series A, 500+ customers, and self-reported profitability. The catch? Zero dedicated designers. This is not a small design team. It is no design team.

## The Numbers

Delve's trajectory is unusually aggressive for a compliance startup:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valuation | $300M (Jul 2025, Series A) |
| Total Funding | $35.3M |
| Revenue | ~$2.6M ARR |
| Customers | 500+ (up from 100 in Jan 2025) |
| Employees | ~33 |
| Designers | 0 |
| Profitability | Self-reported profitable |

The $300M valuation on $2.6M revenue gives a 115x revenue multiple. For context, [LiveKit](/company/livekit) trades at 270x and [Anthropic](/company/anthropic) at roughly 26x. Investors are pricing in the compliance market tailwind: every AI startup needs SOC 2 to close enterprise deals, and Delve promises to get them there faster than anyone.

## The Founders: MIT Dropouts Who Met Week One

CEO Karun Kaushik and COO Selin Kocalar share a remarkably similar trajectory. Both were MIT AI researchers. Both dropped out sophomore year in 2023. They met their first week at MIT, sharing the same academic advisor.

The origin story writes itself: they were building an AI medical scribe together and hit a HIPAA compliance wall. The evidence-gathering process was so painfully manual -- screenshots, spreadsheets, scattered documentation across dozens of tools -- that they pivoted to solve the problem itself.

Kaushik's background is non-traditional even by startup standards: he dropped out of high school, took 25 community college classes, and built an AI COVID diagnostic tool that scaled internationally. Kocalar published 8 research papers, launched an experiment to the International Space Station, and completed Navy SEAL bootcamp. Both were 21 when they raised their Series A.

Their investor list signals credibility: Y Combinator (W24 batch), Insight Partners (Series A lead), General Catalyst, and angel investors including CISOs from Fortune 500 companies.

## What Delve Actually Does

Think of compliance like a massive evidence-collection exercise. To get SOC 2 certified, a company needs to prove it follows hundreds of security controls. Traditionally, this means:

1. Manually screenshot configurations from AWS, GitHub, Slack, HR systems
2. Write policies from scratch
3. Map evidence to control requirements
4. Hire an auditor
5. Spend months going back and forth

Delve's AI agents do steps 1-3 autonomously. The agents connect to your infrastructure, understand your company context, scan code and configurations, auto-fill security questionnaires, and monitor compliance gaps in real-time. The platform bundles auditor services, compressing the entire process from months to days.

The customer impact numbers are concrete: 11x saved 143 hours and unlocked $2.3M in enterprise contracts. Bland closed $500K+ ARR within a week of getting certified. Customers have used Delve compliance to close deals with Walmart, Chase, [OpenAI](/company/openai), Microsoft, and Hertz.

## The Competition: David vs. Multiple Goliaths

This is where the picture gets complicated. Delve operates in one of the most competitive corners of B2B SaaS:

| Competitor | Valuation | Key Strength |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Vanta | $2.5B+ | Market leader, 35+ frameworks |
| Drata | $2B+ | Engineering-first, real-time monitoring |
| Secureframe | N/A | White-glove onboarding |
| Sprinto | N/A | Multi-framework scaling |

Delve's pitch: those incumbents built on manual workflows and added AI features later. Delve was AI-native from day one. The risk is that Vanta and Drata are aggressively adding AI capabilities to their already mature, deeply integrated platforms.

## The Design Opportunity: Building from Absolute Zero

This is the headline for designers.

**Current design team: 0 people.** Not 2-3 like [LiveKit](/company/livekit). Not 5-6 like a typical Series A. Zero.

Delve has two open design roles:

| Role | Level | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| Founding Product Designer | Not specified | SF, on-site |
| Senior Product Designer | 7+ years | SF, on-site |

The Senior Product Designer job description reveals the depth of the challenge: "Dealbreaker-level strength in information architecture. Experience designing products with 10+ interconnected modules." The role explicitly mentions designing systems that support "workflow resumption and long-running user journeys" and "cross-workflow dependencies."

This is not a "make it pretty" role. This is architecting a 10+ module platform from scratch.

## Why This Matters for Product Designers

### 1. The IA Challenge is Genuinely Hard

Compliance platforms have inherent complexity. Delve manages policies, evidence, controls, frameworks, tests, vendors, personnel, training, incidents, and risk assessments -- all interconnected. Designing coherent navigation across 10+ modules where actions in one affect states in another is one of the hardest IA problems in B2B SaaS.

### 2. AI Agent Transparency is Uncharted Territory

When an AI agent autonomously scans your codebase and marks a control as "compliant," how do you build user trust? Compliance is high-stakes -- a wrong determination could mean failed audits and lost enterprise deals. Designing transparency, explainability, and appropriate human oversight for autonomous agents is a design frontier that few have tackled.

### 3. Maximum Ownership, Maximum Risk

Being the first designer at a $300M company means you define everything: the design system, the component library, the interaction patterns, the design culture. There is no existing framework to inherit. There is also no senior design peer to learn from, no design critique culture, and no established process.

### 4. Compliance as Revenue Enabler

Unlike most B2B tools where UX improvements drive adoption metrics, at Delve the designer directly impacts revenue. Every improvement to the compliance workflow helps customers close enterprise deals faster. The connection between design quality and business outcome is unusually direct.

## The Risks

The bear case is significant:

- **Zero design peers**: No mentorship, no critique partner, no design advocate in leadership. You are alone.
- **Product maturity**: User reviews cite manual cleanup steps, incomplete workflows, and glitchy experiences. The product needs work.
- **Young leadership**: Founders are 21. Glassdoor reviews (4.1/5 overall, but 3.6/5 career opportunities) mention "leadership doesn't really know what they are doing." Management experience may be thin.
- **On-site required**: San Francisco, no remote option.
- **Crowded market**: Competing against companies with 10-50x more resources and established customer bases.
- **Compliance is compliance**: The domain can feel dry. Not every designer wants to spend their days thinking about SOC 2 controls and HIPAA evidence mapping.

## The Verdict

Delve is the most extreme ground-floor design opportunity in the AIDO database. No other $300M company has zero designers. The IA challenges are genuinely complex, the AI agent design problems are novel, and the connection between design and business outcome is direct.

For a senior designer who wants maximum ownership and is comfortable building alone in an engineering-first culture, this could be career-defining. For a designer who needs mentorship, design peers, or a structured environment, this would be a difficult fit.

The two open roles signal the company is ready to invest in design. The question is whether you want to be the one who builds it from nothing.
