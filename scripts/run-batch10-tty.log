[2026-02-13 22:31:48] RUN: R1 NextAI
Based on my research, here's the situation:

**There is no single notable "NextAI" that fits the AIDO company profile well.** The entities I found are:

1. **NEXT AI (nextcanada.com)** — An accelerator program in Canada, not a product company
2. **NEXT AI (nextapp.co)** — A customer intelligence platform (could be a fit, but very small/early with no public funding data)
3. **Next AI (en-nextai.com)** — A low-cost bundled AI tool suite ($14.95), not a serious AI-native startup
4. **NextAI Studios (Kenya)** — Very early-stage, founded 2023
5. **NextAI (Bengaluru)** — No-code GenAI tools, very small

**None of these qualify as a notable AI-native startup worth profiling in AIDO.** The most interesting one might be the customer intelligence platform at nextapp.co, but it has:
- No public funding data
- No known founders
- No Crunchbase/PitchBook presence
- No press coverage
- No open design roles

Would you like me to:
1. **Profile the NEXT AI customer intelligence platform (nextapp.co)** with whatever limited data is available?
2. **Skip this company** — it doesn't meet the AIDO quality bar for profiling?
3. **Try a different company name** — did you mean a different company?

If you can share the specific website URL for the "NextAI" you had in mind, I can research that exact company.

## Batch Verification Summary

### 7 Files Verified (PASS with fixes)

| Company | File | Status | Issues Found |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Terrene** | `terrene.ts` | PASS | No issues. Dates `2017-07` valid. `leadInvestors: ['Techstars', 'Right Side Capital Management']` verified. |
| **OpenOcean Robotics** | `open-ocean-robotics.ts` | PASS | No issues. Dates `2021-12`, `2024-10` valid. First round has `leadInvestors: []` (unknown) — correct. |
| **C2RO** | `c2ro.ts` | PASS | No issues. Dates `2018-05`, `2019-07` valid. Lead investors named. |
| **Meya** | `meya.ts` | PASS | No issues. Dates valid. Pre-seed round has `leadInvestors: []` — correct (Kickstarter-like). |
| **UrbanLogiq** | `urbanlogiq.ts` | PASS | No issues. Date `2018-01` valid. `leadInvestors: ['500 Startups']` verified. |
| **Aerial** | `aerial.ts` | PASS | Dates valid. `leadInvestors: []` for first round (unknown) — correct. |
| **SortSpoke** | `sortspoke.ts` | PASS | (Not in original 10 but reviewed.) Clean. |

### 2 Fixes Applied

| Fix | File | Change |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Missing fundingHistory** | `sightline-innovation.ts` | Added `fundingHistory` array with seed round `CAD $4.5M`, date `2016`, `leadInvestors: []` (no known lead) |
| **Missing from index array** | `index.ts` | Added `aerial` to the `companies[]` array (was imported but not included) |

### 3 Files DO NOT EXIST

| Company | Expected File | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **NextAI** | `src/data/companies/nextai.ts` | NOT FOUND — no file, not in index |
| **Composio** | `src/data/companies/composio.ts` | NOT FOUND — `composite.ts` exists but is a different company |
| **Blok** | `src/data/companies/blok.ts` | NOT FOUND — no file, not in index |

These 3 companies need to be researched and created from scratch (out of scope for verification pass).

### Visual Assets Check
- `ogImage` set on: OpenOcean Robotics, C2RO, Meya, UrbanLogiq, SortSpoke — all reference existing files in `public/og-images/`
- No `screenshot` fields found on any of the 10 target companies (Automat had one but is not in scope)
