[15:29:21] Worktree synced to latest main.
[15:29:21] === Phase 2a: Deep research (Phases 1-8) ===
Deep research for Listen Labs is complete (Phases 1-8). Here's a summary:

---

**Listen Labs — Deep Research Complete**

**Report**: `src/data/deep-research/listen-labs.md`
**Company data updated**: `src/data/companies/listen-labs.ts`
**Build**: Verified passing

**Key Findings:**
- **Score**: 7.15/10 (Tier 1)
- **Valuation**: $500M (Series B, Jan 2026)
- **Funding**: $100M total (Sequoia + Ribbit Capital)
- **Revenue**: 15x growth to 8-figure ARR in 9 months
- **Team**: ~45 employees, **0 designers** — hiring first founding product designer
- **Founders**: Alfred Wahlforss (Swedish serial entrepreneur, Harvard, SoundCloud family) + Florian Juengermann (IOI medalist, ex-Tesla Autopilot, Harvard)
- **Key opportunity**: Founding designer building design from zero at a Sequoia-backed rocket ship with genuinely novel AI conversation design challenges
- **Key risk**: Lone designer in an engineering-dominant culture with no design mentorship, below-market base comp ($120-150K), and intense competition (Outset, Aaru, Keplar)
- **Competition**: Outset ($51M), Aaru ($1B val), Keplar (Kleiner Perkins) — market is heating up fast

**Stopped after Phase 8 as instructed. No git commands executed.**
[15:37:37] Phase 2a completed successfully.
[15:37:37] Phase 2a duration: 496s
[15:37:37] Research file verified: 20679 bytes
[15:37:37] === Phase 2b: Article generation (fresh context) ===
Done. Here's a summary of what was created:

**Article**: "Listen Labs Deep Dive: The $500M AI Company With Zero Designers"

**Angle**: The founding designer opportunity — a $500M Sequoia-backed company that has never employed a single product designer, now hiring its first.

**Key sections**:
- **The Business**: Harvard co-founders (SoundCloud family + Tesla Autopilot IOI medalist), $100M raised, 15x revenue growth, $500M valuation
- **The Product**: AI that automates qualitative research — interview design, participant recruitment, AI moderation, analysis, and delivery
- **The Design Vacuum**: Zero designers, zero design system, 1:10+ designer-to-engineer ratio, novel AI conversation design challenges
- **The Competition**: Outset ($51M), Aaru ($1B synthetic research), Keplar (Kleiner Perkins), plus foundation model risk
- **Upside-Downside Ledger**: Unbeatable portfolio story vs. lone designer in engineering-dominant culture
- **Verdict**: 7.15/10 — Tier 1 for a specific profile (solo builder who thrives without design peers)
