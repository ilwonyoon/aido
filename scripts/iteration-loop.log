[2026-02-14T16:48:10.149Z] RUN A nextai
I'm having difficulty identifying which specific "NextAI" company you want me to research. There are several entities:

1. **NEXT AI (nextapp.co)** — Customer intelligence platform (Amsterdam, NL). Founders: Moodi Mahmoudi & Ronny Roeller. 11-50 employees.
2. **Next AI (nextcanada.com)** — Canadian accelerator program for AI startups (not a product company).
3. **Next AI (en-nextai.com)** — All-in-one AI marketing toolkit (appears to be a small SaaS tool).
4. **NextAI (nextai-tech.com)** — Custom AI development agency.

None of these are particularly notable AI-native startups with significant funding. Could you clarify which "NextAI" you're referring to? If you have a website URL or additional context (e.g., what the company does, where it's based), that would help me create an accurate profile.

No OG image available from the website. Let me check the file for the specific repair items mentioned: investor unknown rule and any other issues.

The file already has `leadInvestors: []` which is correct for the "investor unknown rule". Let me verify there's no `ogImage` field that needs to be handled, and check if there are any other issues to fix.

Looking at the PASS B repair requirements:
1. **Visual asset missing** — OG image fetch attempted, none available from website. This is acceptable (fallback UI exists).
2. **Enforce investor unknown rule (`leadInvestors: []`)** — Already correct at line 25.
3. **Keep openRoles synced with job-scraper** — Already `[]` with Glassdoor verification source.
4. **No git commands** — Understood.

The file looks solid. The only actionable item was the OG image, which the website doesn't provide. No further code changes needed.

**PASS B Repair Summary for Sightline Innovation:**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Visual asset (OG image) | No image available | `fetch-og-single.mjs` ran — website has no OG image. Fallback UI handles this. |
| `leadInvestors: []` | Already correct | Line 25 — investor unknown rule enforced. |
| `openRoles` sync | Already correct | Empty `[]` with Glassdoor verification in sources (line 195). |
| Data quality | Good | All fields populated, 5 sources, consistent currency (CAD + USD), founders verified. |

No code changes required — file passes all checks.

## NextAI — PASS B Result: DEAD (Unresearchable)

**Finding**: "NextAI" cannot be profiled. Multiple independent research attempts (batch10 R1, iteration-loop PASS A, and this PASS B) all reached the same conclusion:

| Entity | Why it doesn't qualify |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Next AI (NEXT Canada)** | Accelerator program, not a company |
| **en-nextai.com** | Cheap bundled AI tool suite ($14.95), not a serious startup |
| **NextAI Studios (Kenya)** | Very early-stage, tiny |
| **NextAI (Bengaluru)** | No-code GenAI tools, very small |

None have significant funding, AI-native innovation, or a design team — they don't meet AIDO's minimum bar for inclusion.

**Action taken**: Updated `iteration-loop-state.json` to mark `nextai` as `status: "dead"` with explanation. No company file created (correctly — there's nothing to profile).

1. **Visual asset missing** — Fixed. Fetched OG image via `fetch-og-single.mjs`, saved to `public/og-images/aerial-og.webp`, and added `ogImage` field to company file.

2. **Indentation fix** — The script inserted ogImage with 4-space indent + comment. Cleaned to 2-space indent, no comment.

3. **Investor unknown rule** — Already correct. First funding round (2017-03, $2.25M) has `leadInvestors: []` since no lead investor info is available. Other rounds have verified investors (Intel Capital, Yaletown).

4. **openRoles** — Already `[]` with career page verification recorded in sources (`'Aerial Technologies Careers - no Product Design roles found'`).

Based on the research, **Next AI is a Canadian non-profit accelerator program, NOT an AI product company**. It:

- Is run by NEXT Canada (a non-profit)
- Provides mentorship and up to $100K funding to AI startups
- Has no product/SaaS offering
- Has no product design roles
- Doesn't fit AIDO's scope (AI-native product companies with design opportunities)

**This company should NOT be added to AIDO.** The AIDO system tracks AI-native product companies (Level A-D) where designers could potentially work. Next AI is an accelerator/incubator, not a product company — there are no design roles, no product to evaluate, and no fit score to assign.

If you were looking for a different company also named "NextAI" (there are several), let me know which one:
- **Next AI Company LLC** (Massachusetts, MIT-affiliated)
- **Next AI** (en-nextai.com) — SaaS toolkit with 12 AI apps
- **NEXT AI** (nextapp.co) — Customer intelligence platform
- **Next AI Asia** (nextai.asia) — Business automation
